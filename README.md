## 🚀 Purpose

In today's fast-paced, digitalised world, mental health has become more crucial than ever. Young people, in particular, are facing unprecedented levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The pressures of social media, academic demands, and societal expectations have contributed to a growing mental health crisis among the youth. 

By providing a structured way to track and understand emotions, Memobanking aims to be a proactive platform in addressing these issues. It encourages self-awareness and emotional regulation, key components in maintaining mental health and preventing the escalation of mental illnesses. Whether for personal growth or mental health management, Memobanking offers users valuable tools to navigate and understand one’s emotional landscape.  Through personalised insights and the ability to share experiences, Memobanking not only aids individual users but also fosters a broader conversation about mental health, promoting understanding and support within the community.

## 📝 Project Development Log

In this project, I have opted to use a Kanban workflow as my method of planning and tracking the development of my application. Each column represents a different phase of development. Cards flow from one column to the next as they progress towards completion. The workflow involves the following phases: Backlog, To-Do, In-Progress, Review and Completed.
