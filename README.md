Through personalised insights and the ability to share experiences, Memobanking not only aids individual users but also fosters a broader conversation about mental health, promoting understanding and support within the community.

## üìù Project Development Log

In this project, I have opted to use a Kanban workflow as my method of planning and tracking the development of my application. Each column represents a different phase of development. Cards flow from one column to the next as they progress towards completion. The workflow involves the following phases: Backlog, To-Do, In-Progress, Review and Completed.
